# STA-215-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. I took the discography of the Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard and analyzed the lengths, topics, and descriptions of songs, what album each is on, as well as how much I personally enjoyed each song. I sought to figure out if I enjoyed a certain type of song more than others and what album I rated the highest statistically.

## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "UPDATED FINAL PROJ DATASET - Sheet1 (2).csv" file.

## **Data**
The data collected for this project was songs from the studio albums of the band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Being a band that explores a wide range of genres, the main goal of the analysis was to determine which types of songs listeners enjoy the most and comparing that to which ones I enjoyed the most. I analyzed their discography by taking account each song's length in seconds, by finding the number of listens, categorizing each song into a few possible descriptions, categorizing the lyrical content into certain topics, giving each song a rating based on how much I enjoyed it, and inputting which album each song was on.

## **Operationalization**
To operationalize, I looked at a variety of sources ranging from the government sites and other relevant sites that could provide insight into the question of if ethnicity has a relationship with political party. 
I looked at every senator's ethnicity and the political party their in and used that data to establish if there is or is not a relationship. The project looked for higher or lower rates for being republican, democrat, or other
among White, Black, Hispanic, and Other caategories.
