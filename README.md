# STA-215-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. I decided to take 2 of my variables from my group project, the "Ethnicity" and "Political Party" variables respectively. I wanted to investigate if there was any establishable relationship between someone's political party and their ethnicity, i.e if there was a significantly higher group of white people in the Republican party. 

## **Instructions**
To gather our data, I looked at a Pew Research study on racial & ethnic diversity in the U.S Senate, I categorized this into "1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Hispanic, 4 = Other". I then looked at the U.S Senate's website to gather each of the 100 senator's political parties. I then compared and contrasted the two datasets and tried to establish any connections. 

## **Data**
The data was collected by looking at each of the 100 U.S Senators's ethnicities and their respective political parties. I then looked for noticable trends and categorized any that were noticable. This was then presented through my graphs. 

## **Operationalization**
To operationalize, I looked at a variety of sources ranging from the government sites and other relevant sites that could provide insight into the question of if ethnicity has a relationship with political party. 
I looked at every senator's ethnicity and the political party their in and used that data to establish if there is or is not a relationship. The project looked for higher or lower rates for being republican, democrat, or other
among White, Black, Hispanic, and Other caategories.
